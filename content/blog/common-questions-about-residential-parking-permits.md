2. **What are the costs associated with obtaining a residential parking permit?**

   Costs can vary significantly by area. Many programs have a small administrative fee to cover the costs of permit creation and distribution. Some areas, however, offer free permits as part of municipal benefits. Check with your local authority for specific pricing.
